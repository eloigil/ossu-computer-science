# [Hashing and classes]()

## Hashing
Is how dictionaries are implemented in python
_++ efficient --> ++ space_


`hash(i) --> (0->k)`
takes an integer `i` and converts it to another integer from range 0 to k. We'll use this int to index into a list of lists
```
bucket: each list item that is a list itself
  v
|[ ]|[ ]|[ ]|[ ]|[ ]|
```

It is a list of lists cause hash function is **_many-to-one_**. It means an infinite number of values will hash to the same bucket. When this happens, it is called a **collision**.
There are many ways to deal with collisions. One of the is **linear rehashing**: (not actually rehashing) just keeping a list

Any kind of immutable object can be hashed


## Exceptions
**Unhandled exceptions** will cause the program to crash

### try/except
```
try:
    [...]
except:
    [...]
```
Program will run the code in `try`. But if it raises an exception, it will imediatelly stop running the code in `try` and start running the code in `except`

## Classes
Module: collection of related functions
```
import math
math.log
    ^
    dot notation
```
imports a lot of convenient things at once and the uses dot notation to disambiguate (avoiding conflicts eg: _Set.member_ & _Table.member_)

**Class**: collection of data and functions
Data and functions are bound together so that you can pass an object from one part of the program to another and automatically gets access to the functions automatically associated with that type of object

**Object-oriented programming**

data and fuctions associated with an object are called **atributes**
a **method** is a function associated with an object

list, Dict... are **built-in classes**
