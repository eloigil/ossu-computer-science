# [Recursion]()

### Divide & conquer: _pick a hard problem and break it into smaller pieces_
- small problems are easy to solve
- the solutions of the small problems can be **easily** combined to solve the original problem

## Recursion
- way of describing problems
- way of designing solutions (divide & conquer)

Base case: direct answer
Recursive (inductive) case: reduce to a simpler version of the same problem + some other simpler operations
