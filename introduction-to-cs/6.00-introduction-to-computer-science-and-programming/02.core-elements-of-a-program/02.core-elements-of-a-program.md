### Integrated Development Environment _eg. IDLE_
- text editor
- shell: environment that interprets the python code. Syntax highlighting.
- debugger

### objects
each object has a **type** _(what is & what we can do)_
- scalar types: indivisible
    - int
    - float
    - bool
    - NoneType
- non-scalar types
    - str

### Expression: _sequence of operands(objects) and operators_
_3/2 = 1_

_3.0/2.0 = 1.5_

'a' + 'b' =  'ab'

"+" is **overloaded**: have a meaning that depends on the type of the operands

### program / script: _sequence of commands_
in python, a **variable** is a name for an object
**assignment** binds the name to the object

**straight line programs**: each line is executed once linearly

### conditionals
    - if
    - elif
    - else

**branching programs** programs that split when running _(if/else)_

**looping construct (Turing complete)**
