_Difficulty of the problem_

### Decrementing function
1. Map set of program variables to an integer
2. Starts with a non-negative value
3. When its value <= 0, loop terminates
4. Decreased each iteration

This is an example of _**gess & check**_ particularly an _**Exhaustive enumeration**_ _aka. **brute force**_ (Goes through the possible answers trying to exhaust them)
