_Difficulty of the problem_

### Decrementing function
1. Map set of program variables to an integer
2. Starts with a non-negative value
3. When its value <= 0, loop terminates
4. Decreased each iteration

This is an example of _**gess & check**_ particularly an _**Exhaustive enumeration**_ _aka. **brute force**_ (Goes through the possible answers trying to exhaust them) 

### for loop

```
for ans in range(a,b):
    [break]
```

* _range(x,y) = (x, x+1, x+2, ..., y-1) generates a tuple_
* _break_ exits the loop


### Approximation
finding an answer that is good enough

_**bisection search**_:
1. Cut search space in half each iteration
2. Discard the half that doesn't match the number
