# [Memory and search methods]()

## SEARCHES
### NOT IN PYTHON!
Assuming that an int (for example) occuppies 4 units of memory:
Location in memory of L[i]? if we know where the list starts, it will be `start + 4 * i` 
```
List:

|___|___|___|___...
^ start + 0
    ^ start + 4
        ^ start + 8 ...
```
This will work if the elements of the list are the same size â‰ˆ the same type (lists of the same type is something happens in other langauges, but not in python)

to avoid this we can use a Linked list:
- every element of the list is a pointer to the next element and then comes the value
```
List:

|____||____________|
  |
  v
|____||_______|
  |
  v
|none||_________________|
```
`O(i)`

### IN PYTHON
**Indirection**: a list of pointers (same size) where each pointer points to place of the memory no matters the size

#### eg. in binary search:
- list must be ordered to do a binary search
- the algorithm fill follow this pattern:
    1. sort L
    2. use binary search

Linear search will take `O(len(L))`
We know that binary search takes `O(log(len(L)))`
So if we want the _sort + bSearch_ to be faster than linear, `O(?) + O(log(len(L))) < O(len(L))`. It won't happen cause at least, sort algorithms take `O(L)`
**Amortized complexity**: We can sort the list just once, so if we do enough binary searches, the complexity of the sort operation will be diluded, amortized.

on `K` searches:
`O(sort(L)) + K * log(len(L)) < K * len(L)`
depends on the complexity of `sort(L)` and how big is `K`

## SORTING
### Selection sort
establishing & mantaining invariant
- list has a prefix and a suffix
- invariant = prefix is always sorted
- each step of the algorithm will decrease the suffix by one element and increase the prefix by one element while maintaining the invariant
- will end when `len(suffix) = 0` and `len(prefix) = len(List)`

complexity:
```
n = len(L)
O(n^2)
```

#### Divide & conquer
1. threshold input size, n0, smallest problem
2. how many instances at each division
3. combine sub-solutions
    - merge:
    You can easily merge two sorted lists by taking the firs element of each list, comparing them and putting the proper one into the result list
    
Merge complexity: `O(len(L)) = O(n)` 
Merge solution leads to merge sorting

### Merge sort
Divide the list to the smallest possible: _len(subL) = 1_ and keep merging the sublists until you fianlly merge two sorted sublists

Merge operation will be repeated `O(log(n))`

So finally we have that the Merge sort complexity is: `O(n * log(n))`
