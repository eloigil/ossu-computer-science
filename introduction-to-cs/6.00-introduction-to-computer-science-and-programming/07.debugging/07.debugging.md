# BONUS: Floating point numbers

Computers translate binary base numbers to decimal base numbers.
In case of the fractions, some simple decimal base fractional numbers have to be approximated on binary cause its binary representation is infinite. 

eg. 0.1(decimal) = 0.000110011001100110011... ~= 0.100000000000000005551115123...

- print statement rounds it to 17 digits --> 0.10000000000000001
- if we use repr instead of print it will print a less rounded value


# [Debugging]()
Is not to eliminate one bug quickly.
Is to move towards a bug-free program

How could it have produced the result it did?

Study available data
- program text
- text results
_Find the smaller input on which program fails_
Then form a hypothesis consisten with data
Design and run a **repetable** experiment 
- potenitial to refute a hypothesis
