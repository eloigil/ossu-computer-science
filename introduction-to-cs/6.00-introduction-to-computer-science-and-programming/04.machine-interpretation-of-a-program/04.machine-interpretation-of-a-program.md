### Decomposition:  _creates structure_
- **modules**: self-conteined & reusable
### Abstraction: _suppresses detail_
Allows to use a piece of code knowing what it does without knowing how it does it.

## Functions
- name
- parameters
- body

```
def functionName(p1, p2, ..., pN):
    //body
    return ...
```
If there's no return statement, it will return _None_ by default

call a function:
```
functionName(v1, v2, ..., vN)
```

When a function is called:
1. The formal parameter X is **bound** to the value of the actual parameter X
2. Upon entry of a function, a new **scope** is created.
- scope is a mapping from names to objects

**Stack**: how functions get executed (scopes created and resolved) in computing. _**Last in first out**_
