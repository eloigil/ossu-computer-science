### Tuples (immutable: can't change its value)
### Lists (mutable)

Tuples and lists are ordered sequences of objects

- slice: range of values (subsequence)

- append: is a method. It mutates a list (it has a side effect)
```
List.append(x)
```
- remove

- sort

_*alias*: one object for different names_


### Dictionaries
Dict is a set of key value pairs
- elements are not ordered
- indeces are not numbers, they are called keys and can be any immutable type
