# [Object-oriented programming and Inheritance]()

## Classes
**Abstract data type**
we are going to define for each type an **interface** that explains what methods do. (Not how they do it)

The **specification** tells us what something does

```
class intSet(object):
               ^ instances of this class will be objects
    def __init__(self):
           ^ something like __[...]__ special status in python
             when an object of this class type is created __init__ will be executed 
        self.num = 47
        self.vals = []
              ^ attributes
    
    def insert(self, e):
                ^ self refers to the instance
                  to call this method we'll pass just one argument obj.insert(e)
                  the 'self' argument comes implicit as we are using an instance method
        [...]
```
```
<<< s = intSet()
<<< s.num
>>> 47
```
_In a new version of the code, if the implementation changes (and the specification remains) all the instance variables (attributes) could also change. So is important **not to access directly** to these instance variables_
**! Data hiding**: No direct access to the instance variables and class variables
Instead of direct access we can use methods:
- **getters** return a value
- **setters** modify a value

_BONUS Methods_:
- `__lt__(self, other)`: less than, replaces the `<` opperation. (If we do a `<` comparision it will use this method instead of just comparing them)
- `__str__(self)`: replaces `str(obj)`

## Inheritance

```
class Student(Person):
    __init__(self, name)
        Person.__init__(self, name)
    
    [...]
```

class `Student` will **inherit super class properties**

```
class Student(Person):
    Student.NextIdNum = 0
      ^ class variable
    __init__(self, name)
        Person.__init__(self, name)
        self.idNum = Student.NextIdNum
        Student.NextIdNum += 1
          ^ modifies class variable
```

**class variables** are variables associated to the class, they are not transmitted to  the instances. _(Are a better use than global variables)_

classes **can override super properties**
